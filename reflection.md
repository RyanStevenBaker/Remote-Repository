Reflection:

Neither of us have had much experience with coding before this assignment. It took us a while to both open Jupyter labs and create a github repository saved to an accessible spot, but once we got them open everything started making sense. When we started we both had our laptops open to Jupyter and were helping each other slowly walk through it. 

At first we couldn't get the code to run properly becasue we were forgeting to put:

import numpy as np
np.pi
3.141592653589793

at the start of the code so it was giving us errors. Once we figured that out we finished the assignment very quickly. I enjoyed working on this assignment with someone becuase we both had valuable ideas that cut down assignment time.
